                <dt>1. U.S. Coins previously contained gold, silver, and copper</dt>
                <dd>- The U.S. Mint originally made coins with precious metals like gold and silver. Eventually, it became too costly to use these materials to create coins. Today, the U.S. Mint creates U.S. coins from Cupro-Nickel and Copper-plated Zinc.</dd>
                <dt>2. 2-cent and 3-cent coins used to exist</dt>
                <dd>- Prior to 1873 and 1889, the U.S. used two and three cent coins because they were practical. However, as prices rose, the U.S. Mint discontinued the production of these particular coins.</dd>
                <dt>3. The “Eagle” was a $10 coin</dt>
                <dd>- Centuries ago, the United States Mint created several “Eagle” coins that represented $2.50, $5, $10, and $20. A $2.50 “Eagle” was known as a quarter eagle. The $5 “Eagle” was called a half eagle, and the $20 coin was called a “Double Eagle.”</dd>
                <dt>4. Pennies can remain in circulation for 40 years</dt>
                <dd>- Eventually the U.S. Mint will recycle coins, but a penny can last an average of 40 years in your wallet!</dd>
                <dt>5. Coins are harder to copy because of the ridged edges!</dt>
                <dd>- During the era when coins were made of gold and silver, Isaac Newton introduced the concept of reeded edges to prevent individuals from tampering with or shaving off the edges to extract valuable metals.</dd>
